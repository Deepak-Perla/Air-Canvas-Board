# Air-Canvas-Board
Air Canvas is a hands-free digital drawing canvas. With Python, Numpy, Collections and OpenCV to recognize and map hand gestures onto the screen. The idea for Air Canvas was a result of our interest in digital drawing and smart photo recognition software.
Made this project with the help of @infoaryan code and some changes in it.
So, wholesomely it is not my code it was written by the help of others.
Thank you
